## Module 1 Lab : Provisioning Office 365

#### **Scenario**

Adatum Corporation is considering moving some of the core on-premises services such as Exchange Server and SharePoint Server to Office 365. The project steering committee needs to ensure that   
‎Office 365 can provide the required functionality and accommodate the corporate security and compliance requirements. To get started, Adatum Corporation has decided to begin a pilot deployment of Office 365 for a group of users in the London office. 

As one of the most experienced IT admins at Adatum Corporation, you are responsible for implementing the pilot project. To start, you need to configure the Office 365 tenant, and then configure the custom domain that your organization uses. You also need to ensure that you are comfortable with the Office 365 administrator interfaces.

#### **Objectives**

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure an Office 365 tenant.

- Configure a custom domain.

- Explore the Office 365 administrator interfaces.

 **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual.   
‎Your instructor will provide the lab documentation.

#### **Lab Setup**

Estimated Time: 75 minutes

Virtual machines: **20347B-LON-DC1** and **20347B-LON-CL1**

	- Where you see references to **Adatum****yyxxxx****.hostdomain.com**, replace the **Adatum****yyxxxx** with your unique hostdomain.com Name displayed in the online lab portal.

This lab requires the following virtual machines (use only the VMs required for your lab):

- **LON-DC1**

	- Sign in as **Adatum\Administrator** by using the password **Pa55w.rd.**

- **LON-CL1**

	- Sign in as **Adatum\Beth** by using the password **Pa55w.rd.**

## Module 2 Lab A: Managing Office 365 users and passwords

#### **Scenario**

After configuring an Office 365 tenant and preparing it for pilot deployment, you are now ready to start creating user and group accounts in Office 365. You and your team need to be familiar with how to configure these accounts by using the Microsoft 365 admin center because this will be your primary tool for managing the environment after the deployment is fully functional. Additionally, you need to make sure that the password policy for Office 365 users matches the password policy for on-premises users.

#### **Objectives**

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Manage Office 365 users and licenses by using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- Manage Office 365 password policies.

 **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

In addition to creating user accounts, you also need to know how to create group accounts in Office 365. In this pilot project, you will use Windows PowerShell commands to manage users and groups. If the pilot is successful, you can manage several hundred users and groups, and Windows PowerShell will be a means to manage them efficiently. One of the goals in the pilot project is to test delegated administration in Office 365, so you also need to delegate password management and billing management to different users.

#### **Objectives**

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Manage Office 365 groups by using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- Manage Office 365 users and groups by using Windows PowerShell.

- Configure delegated administrators.

## Module 13 Lab: Planning and configuring identity federation

#### **Scenario**

Directory synchronization is working well, and it has resolved the issue of managing user accounts in two locations. However, the security group at Adatum is concerned that users will be able to log on directly to Office 365, which reduces their options for monitoring user logons. To ensure that all users will authenticate using the on-premises AD DS domain, you have decided to implement AD FS.

#### **Objectives**

After completing this lab, you should be able to:

- Install and configure AD FS and Web Application Proxy.

- Configure SSO with Office 365.

- Verify that SSO is working.

 **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.
